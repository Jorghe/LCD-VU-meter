# LCD-VU-meter
An audio signal is delivered to a LiquidCrystal Display and plots over time with Arduino.

A 3.5mm jack is plugged into an Analog input for arduino and maping results into a function to obtain a defined character of 8x5 each one, and use 16 rows divided in 2 8 row-long character and plot it in time by scrolling each column in the whole LCD. The controller is using a complex program in Arduino and conected to the following hardware.

Arduino UNO or any other generic device, even larger versions such as Leonardo, Mega, etc.
